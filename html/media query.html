    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p class="html">
        Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing. <br>
        HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
        The code <br> used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching <br> you how to build rather than design.

            The History of HTML
        </h1>
        <p class="history">
            HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>
            Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. <br> The latest version is known as <span>HTML5</span>.
            A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. <br> To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

            What are Tags and Attributes?
        </h1>
        <p class="tags">
            Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.
            They work together but perform different functions â€“ it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
